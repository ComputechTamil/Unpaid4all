INSTRUCTIONS:

  1. Disable your antivirus.
  
  2. Unrar and install the application.
 
  3. Delete created by default .net native image.
     - Run as admin command prompt (cmd.exe) and
     - Browse to the folder: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\
       and execute command: ngen uninstall csibridge

  4. Run "CSiBridge.v23_kg" (...\Patch_CSiBridge.v23.2.0\Patch)
     Name: lavteam.org 
     Password: 9A4232D4-86CD30BE-953527E5-3B1CB1A6
     - A license file (lservrc) will be generated.

  5. Copy both generated above license and applied emulator (SentinelRMSCore.dll) to the folders: 
     - <installdir>
     - <installdir>\CSiLicensing\

  ============= Enjoy ==============


Notes.
 1. Allow program's access to the internet otherwise program will not even start.

 2. You can try to replace SentinelRMSCore.ni.dll besides deleting native image - program will start
    much faster. But the good result is not guaranteed. The program may not even start. On what does the
    success depend on is a big question at the moment.
    So replace: 
      C:\Windows\assembly\NativeImages_v4.0.30319_64\SentinelRMSCore\bla-bla-bla(depends on product)\SentinelRMSCore.ni.dll
       with ...\Patch_CSiBridge.v23.2.0\Native images\SentinelRMSCore.ni.dll
 3. Do not use Windows Explorer for replacing SentinelRMSCore.ni.dll. No chance to do this with it. Use Total Commander
    (for example) with turning on option for showing hidden files.
