Notes.
 1. Allow program's access to the internet otherwise program will not even start.
 2. All, who used "Perform native image	generation ..." while installing, has also to replace:
    C:\Windows\assembly\NativeImages_v4.0.30319_64\SentinelRMSCore\bla-bla-bla(depend on product)\SentinelRMSCore.ni.dll
    with the one from kg ...\kg_CSiBridge.v22\Native Images\SentinelRMSCore.ni.dll
 3. Do not use Windows Explorer for replacing SentinelRMSCore.ni.dll. No chance to do this with it. Use Total Commander
    (for example) with turning on option for showing hidden files.
